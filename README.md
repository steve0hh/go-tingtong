# Go Ting Tong

I always like the [awareness](http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/) app on OSX.

When I switched to Linux, I couldn't find something that is similar to it so I decided to build it myself using go.

Note: I haven't quite figured out how to distribute the binary out yet.
Do contact me if you want me to build it for you.


## Build it youself

```bash
# To run
~ pkger # builds pkged.go
~ go run main.go counter.go pkged.go

# To build
~ pkger
~ go build # go-ting-tong binary should be generated
```
